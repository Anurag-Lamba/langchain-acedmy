Looking at the raw content, there's a table with Honda CB350 variants. The images at the top show the Honda logo and the CB350 model. The table lists different variants: DLX, DLX Pro, and Special Edition. Each has specifications like price, engine displacement, power, mileage, brakes, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main purpose of the webpage is to present the specifications and pricing of different Honda CB350 motorcycle variants. It's a product page for the Honda CB350 models.

      "Looking at the table, each row has specific data. The ex-showroom prices are given, engine displacement is 348.36 CC for all, max power is 21.07 PS @5500 rpm for all except maybe the Special Edition? Wait, no, looking at the table, all three variants have the same power and displacement. The differences are in price, clutch type (for Special Edition it's Assist & Slipper), and maybe the name. The mileage is listed as KM/L but no specific number, just \"KM/L\" which might be a placeholder. Brakes are Double Disc for all. Gear box 5 Speed for all. Kerb weight 187 kg for all. Starting is Self Start Only except for Special Edition? Wait, no, the Starting column for all says \"Self Start Only\". Wait, looking again: \n",

      "The page also has some images of the bike and logo, and then a bunch of \"Callicon\" icons and a call close image, which might be contact buttons, but since they're just images without text, maybe they're for calling the dealer. But the main content is the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terms & conditions are mentioned with a link, but the actual terms aren't in the content, just a link.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I'll read through the content to understand the main topic. The page is about the Royal Enfield Classic motorcycle models. It has sections on first and second generations, specs, production years, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main points: The Royal Enfield Classic 350 and 500 are retro cruiser motorcycles. First generation from 2009-2021, second generation (Classic 350 Reborn) starting 2022. They replaced the Machismo. The Classic 500 was discontinued in 2019, replaced by BS6 engines with dual ABS. The 2022 model has a redesigned engine, chassis, etc. Specs like engine size, power, torque, dimensions, brakes. Also, reception from reviews, prices in different regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check for key facts: Production years, engine specs, generations, changes between them, notable features like ABS, fuel injection, color options. Also, the end of Classic 500 production in 2019, new BS6 engines. Second gen's specs like 349cc engine, 20.2 hp, etc. Price points in India and Germany. Reception mentions it's not for speed but fun and friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Need to structure the summary. Start with main topic: Royal Enfield Classic models, their history, specs, generations. Mention first gen (2009-2021) with 350 and 500 variants, their specs differences. Then second gen (2022+) as Classic 350 Reborn, redesigned with new specs. Note that Classic 500 was discontinued. Include key specs like engine displacement, power, torque, ABS, pricing. Also, mention the reception points from reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check the key excerpts. The webpage has quotes from sources like Cycle World, Rider Magazine. For example, \"a languid, unhurried experience\" from Rider Magazine. Also, the specs details like \"20.2 hp @ 6,100 rpm\" etc. But the key excerpts should be quotes from the text. Let's see: In the Reception section: \"Critics acknowledge riding the motorcycle is 'a languid, unhurried experience' as it was not designed for speed.\" and \"designed to be fun and friendly to a wide range of riders.\" Also, maybe the price in Germany: \"In Germany, it starts at €4,890 (US$5,783.4).\" But the key excerpts are supposed to be important quotes. The original text has quotes from sources like \"2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 | First Ride Review\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the guidelines say \"Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.\" So look for direct quotes in the content. The references section has links to articles, but the content maybe quotes from those articles. For example, in the Reception section: \"Critics acknowledge riding the motorcycle is 'a languid, unhurried experience' as it was not designed for speed.\" and \"designed to be fun and friendly to a wide range of riders.\" Also, maybe \"Our findings indicate...\" but that's not here. Wait, the webpage content itself has quotes from the sources. Let me check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the \"Reception\" section: \"The global motorcycle press reviews for the redesigned Classic 350 have been favorable at launch. Critics acknowledge riding the motorcycle is 'a languid, unhurried experience' as it was not designed for speed. However, the handling, fuel economy, ergonomics, low-price, quality, and beauty of the motorcycle suggest it was 'designed to be fun and friendly to a wide range of riders.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So those two quotes in quotes are key excerpts. Also, maybe the price in Germany. But the example shows key excerpts as direct quotes from the content. So \"a languid, unhurried experience...\" and \"designed to be fun and friendly...\" are the main ones. Also maybe the MSRP in the specs: \"$4,499–$4,699\", but that's a number, not a quote. The quotes in the text are the ones in the Reception section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, check if there are other quotes. For example, in the references, the article mentions \"2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 First Look\" from Cycle World, but the actual quotes from the article are in the Reception section. So the key excerpts should be the direct quotes from the content. The two sentences in quotes in the Reception section.\n",
      "\n",
      "So key_excerpts would be:\n",

      "1. Critics acknowledge riding the motorcycle is \"a languid, unhurried experience\" as it was not designed for speed.\n",

Features like semi-digital instrument console, Bluetooth, turn-by-turn navigation, LED headlights, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the price is mentioned as ₹1,83,840 ex-showroom. The warranty is 3 years or 42,000 km. Service schedule includes 3 free services at specific km and days.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the features section, there's a list of features like seat type (stepped), pillion footrest, grab rail, Honda Selectable Torque Control, etc. The FAQs mention top speed, weight, fuel tank capacity, seat height.\n",
      "\n",
      "The similar bikes section lists models like Royal Enfield Classic 350, Hness CB350, Meteor 350, etc., but maybe the main focus is on the CB350 itself, so those might be secondary. However, the key is to have the main specs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the summary, I need to highlight the key specs and features. Maybe structure it as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Overview: Honda CB350 is a 350cc motorcycle with specific performance metrics.\n",
      "- Key specs: engine details, power, torque, top speed, mileage, transmission, ABS, etc.\n",

      "\n",
      "But need to keep it concise. The original content has a lot of details, but the summary should be about 25-30% of the original. Let's see.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original webpage content is quite long with multiple sections. The main content is the specs and features. The key parts are the numbers and the main features.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The Honda CB350 is a 348.36cc air-cooled motorcycle with 20.7 bhp at 5,500 rpm and 29.5 Nm torque at 3,000 rpm. It offers a top speed of 130 kmph and owner-reported mileage of 35 kmpl. Features include dual-channel ABS, semi-digital instrument console with Bluetooth connectivity, LED lighting, and Honda Selectable Torque Control. The bike weighs 186 kg, has an 800 mm seat height, and a 15.2-liter fuel tank. It comes with a 3-year/42,000 km warranty and three free services.\"\n",

      "Looking at the content, there's a lot of descriptive text. Let me break it down. The headline says \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style.\" Then it talks about the Classic 350's heritage from the 1950 Royal Enfield G2. It mentions seven new colorways inspired by past, present, future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next part: \"TRENDING SINCE 1950 Unmatched design. Unmistakable style. Unrivalled craftsmanship.\" They mention modern engineering and traditional handcrafting, exhaust note. Then \"CRAFTED, NOT BUILT.\" with details about riding posture, seat, footpegs, handlebars for comfort.\n",

      "\n",
      "Key points:\n",
      "- First Generation (2009-2021): Classic 350 and 500 with different engines (carbureted vs EFI), specs details like displacement, power, torque, dimensions, brakes, etc. The 500 was discontinued in 2019, replaced by BS6 engines with dual ABS. They mention the Classic 500 Tribute Black as a final run.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Second Generation (2022+): Classic 350 Reborn with redesigned engine (SOHC air/oil-cooled), new chassis, suspension, brakes. Specs like 349cc, 20.2 hp, price in India and Germany, and the Goan Classic 350 Bobber version in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reception: Positive reviews, described as \"languid, unhurried experience\" not for speed but fun and friendly for various riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Key specs for each generation are detailed in tables, but for the summary, I should highlight the main differences between generations and important numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important quotes: The reviews from Rider Magazine and Cycle World mentioned in references. For example, \"a languid, unhurried experience\" and \"designed to be fun and friendly to a wide range of riders.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Need to check the key excerpts. The references have quotes like from Greg Drevenstedt in Rider Magazine and Cycle World's buyer's guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the production years, engine types, displacement, power, torque, ABS features, pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure the summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "Start with the main topic: Royal Enfield Classic series, covering Classic 350 and 500 models since 2009, with two generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "First generation: 2009-2021, Classic 350 (carbureted) and 500 (EFI), specs. Mention that 500 was discontinued in 2019, replaced by BS6 versions with dual ABS. The 350 had ammeter in older models, but modern ones don't use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second generation: Launched in 2021 for 2022 model year as Classic 350 Reborn. Redesigned with new engine (SOHC, air/oil-cooled), specs like 349cc, 20.2 hp, 19 lb-ft torque. Price points in India and Germany. 2024's Goan Classic 350 Bobber variant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reception: Reviews note it's not for speed but fun and user-friendly. Specific quotes from reviewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key excerpts: The exact phrases from the reviews. For example, \"a languid, unhurried experience\" and \"designed to be fun and friendly to a wide range of riders.\" Also maybe the price details, but the key excerpts should be quotes from credible sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check the references section. Reference 5 says: \"Critics acknowledge riding the motorcycle is 'a languid, unhurried experience' as it was not designed for speed.\" And reference 6: \"the handling, fuel economy, ergonomics, low-price, quality, and beauty of the motorcycle suggest it was 'designed to be fun and friendly to a wide range of riders.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the key excerpts would be those two quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, check if there are other quotes. In the references, reference 5 has a quote from Drevenstedt, but the actual quote isn't given in the text, just the citation. The main text says \"Critics acknowledge riding the motorcycle is 'a languid, unhurried experience'...\" and the next sentence says \"...designed to be fun and friendly...\". So those are the key excerpts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the summary needs to be concise.\n",
      "For troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE \n",
      "Failed to summarize webpage: Invalid json output: Okay, let me tackle this. I need to summarize the Royal Enfield Classic 350 review webpage. First, I'll read through the content to understand the main points.\n",
      "\n",
      "The webpage is a review of the 2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 motorcycle. The author is Dan Sutherland, updated in February 2025. The main topic is the bike's features, performance, and user reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the structure: there's an introduction, highlights, prices, overall rating, sections on ride quality, brakes, engine, reliability, value vs rivals, equipment, specs, and owner reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points to include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- It's a budget retro bike priced at £4439 (launch price), now used around £3300-4000.\n",
      "- 350cc air-cooled single-cylinder engine, 20 bhp, top speed 71 mph.\n",
      "- Styling is vintage, with chrome tank, spoked wheels, analog clock.\n",
      "- Pros: good build quality, charm, fuel efficiency (77.7 mpg), comfortable for two, affordable.\n",
      "- Cons: brakes lack feel, no sixth gear, struggles on motorways, suspension adjustment hard.\n",
      "- Owners' rating is 4.5/5 overall.\n",
      "- Specific issues mentioned: speedo sticking in heat, rust on fuel tank, some build quality issues like unfinished spokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owner reviews have specific anecdotes. For example, one owner says \"The bike is all about effortless lofty torque that propels you along like a pilot and instilling you with a sense of adventure.\" Another mentions \"Brakes are adequate for the power and weight of the bike, not brilliant quality but serviceable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the value proposition: cheaper than competitors, good for A2 license holders, second bike for experienced riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Need to check the key stats: weight 195kg, seat height 805mm, annual service cost £180.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summary should capture the main positives and negatives, the target audience (retro lovers, new riders), and key specs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structure the summary. Start with the main purpose: a review of the Royal Enfield Classic 350, highlighting its retro style, performance, pros and cons, and owner feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key excerpts: select 3-5 quotes from the owner reviews that are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible excerpts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"It’s a charming blend of just enough power, great build quality and quaint styling that harks back to the golden age of British motorcycling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"Brakes are adequate for the power and weight of the bike, not brilliant quality but serviceable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"The bike is all about effortless lofty torque that propels you along like a pilot and instilling you with a sense of adventure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"Annual servicing cost: £180\" (but maybe not a quote, but a fact. Wait, the key excerpts should be quotes. So maybe owner quotes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the owner reviews section:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"It looks fantastic, comfortable and relaxing to ride! I’m 6ft 6 so very hard to find bikes I can ride! ... Ride with a grin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Brakes are adequate, some people have said they're poor. They're not, they're fine, front not snatchy, progressive and reliable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"This is a bike I can see myself keeping for a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"The bike is all about effortless lofty torque that propels you along like a pilot and instilling you with a sense of adventure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"A gentle, relaxed, comfortable cruiser. Plenty of leg room with knees in a comfortable, relaxed position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So pick 3-5 of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, check the main points from the article. The overall rating is 4.5/5 from owners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, structure the summary concisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start with the main idea: The Royal Enfield Classic 350 is a budget-friendly retro motorcycle praised for its charming style, solid build, and comfortable ride, but with some drawbacks like brake feel and limited top speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Include key specs: 350cc engine, 20bhp, 71mph top speed, 77.7mpg fuel economy, £4439 new price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mention it's suitable for A2 license holders and as a second bike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: build quality, fuel efficiency, comfort, retro aesthetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: brakes lack feel, no sixth gear, suspension adjustment difficult, speedo issues in heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owner reviews highlight comfort, charm, and value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key excerpts could be quotes from owners about comfort, brakes, and overall experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me draft the summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",

None of the results are from honda.com. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any results from honda.com. That\\'s important to note.\\n\\nNow, the task is to clean up all the relevant information from these sources, preserving verbatim, excluding think_tool calls.\\n\\nSo first, list all the tool calls that are relevant. The tavily_search calls and their responses, but exclude the think_tool.\\n\\nSo the relevant tool responses are:\\n\\n1.

Third tavily_search (query \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\") returned three sources.\\n\\nBut all these sources have overlapping URLs. For example, the CMC Help Center URL is repeated in all three searches.\\n\\nNow, the task is to list all these sources, but without duplicates. However, the instruction says to preserve all information, including duplicates if they are in the sources. But the citation rules say to assign each unique URL a single citation number. So even if the same URL appears multiple times in different searches, it should be cited once.\\n\\nSo first, collect all the unique URLs from all the tool responses.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all URLs from the search results:\\n\\nFrom first tavily_search response:\\n\\nSource 1: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSource 2: https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\nSource 3: https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nSecond tavily_search response:\\n\\nSame three URLs again. So same sources.\\n\\nThird tavily_search response for \"site:honda.com\" also shows same three URLs. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any honda.com URLs, so all sources are the same.\\n\\nThus, unique URLs are three: CMC, Universal Honda, BikeWale.\\n\\nNow, for each of these, we need to include all the summary text verbatim.\\n\\nBut in the first search, the CMC source summary was:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\"\\n\\nIn the third search\\'s Source 1, it says:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\"\\n\\nSo slightly different. So need to include both versions? Wait, but it\\'s the same URL. However, the summaries are different. So perhaps the same URL was accessed multiple times with different content? Or maybe the CMC Help Center page has different summaries depending on when it was accessed. But the instructions say to preserve all information verbatim, so if the same URL has different summary text in different responses, we need to include all instances.\\n\\nBut looking at the first search response for Source 1:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Honda CB350 Specs - CMC Help Center ---\\nURL: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThen in the third search, Source 1 has:\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\\n\\nSo different summary. So even though same URL, the summary text is different. So need to include both instances.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Universal Honda source in first search had a table, and in the third search, the same URL again has the same table.\\n\\nBikeWale in first search: summary says \"Oops! No suggestions found\" etc. But in the third search, same URL again, same summary.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n- For each unique URL, collect all the summary data from all the times it appeared in the search results, and include them verbatim.\\n\\nBut if the same URL has multiple summaries (like in different searches), include all summaries.\\n\\nNow, the steps to create the report:\\n\\n1. List all queries and tool calls made (the tavily_search queries, but not think_tool).\\n\\n2. Fully comprehensive findings: for each source, include all the summary text verbatim, with citations.\\n\\n3. Sources section listing each unique URL with citation number.\\n\\nBut according to the citation rules, each unique URL gets one citation number, regardless of how many times it appears in the search results. But in the findings, whenever the URL is mentioned, cite it with the number.\\n\\nWait, no. The citation rules say: Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text. End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers.\\n\\nSo for example, if the same URL appears in multiple places in the findings, each time cite the same number.\\n\\nBut in the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, we need to list all the information from the sources, each time citing the URL with its number.\\n\\nSo first, collect all unique URLs and assign numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\n2. https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\n3. https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nThat\\'s three unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, for each URL, in the findings section, include all the summary text from all instances.\\n\\nFor example, the first URL appeared in the first search\\'s Source 1 with the first summary, and in the third search\\'s Source 1 with the second summary. So in the findings section, when citing URL 1, we need to include both summaries.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the Universal Honda URL, it appeared in multiple searches with the same table (same summary), so include it once.\\n\\nBikeWale URL appeared multiple times with the same summary (the \"Oops! No suggestions found\" etc), so include it once.\\n\\nWait, but the BikeWale summary in the first search was:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nSpecifications of Honda CB350 | Features of CB350- BikeWale\\n===========================================================\\n\\n[ BikeWale ](https://www.bikewale.com/ \"BikeWale\")\\n\\n- Oops!

None of the results are from honda.com. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any results from honda.com. That\\'s important to note.\\n\\nNow, the task is to clean up all the relevant information from these sources, preserving verbatim, excluding think_tool calls.\\n\\nSo first, list all the tool calls that are relevant. The tavily_search calls and their responses, but exclude the think_tool.\\n\\nSo the relevant tool responses are:\\n\\n1. First tavily_search (query \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\") returned three sources.\\n\\n2. Second tavily_search (query \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\") returned three sources.\\n\\n3. Third tavily_search (query \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\") returned three sources.\\n\\nBut all these sources have overlapping URLs. For example, the CMC Help Center URL is repeated in all three searches.\\n\\nNow, the task is to list all these sources, but without duplicates. However, the instruction says to preserve all information, including duplicates if they are in the sources. But the citation rules say to assign each unique URL a single citation number. So even if the same URL appears multiple times in different searches, it should be cited once.\\n\\nSo first, collect all the unique URLs from all the tool responses.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all URLs from the search results:\\n\\nFrom first tavily_search response:\\n\\nSource 1: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSource 2: https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\nSource 3: https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nSecond tavily_search response:\\n\\nSame three URLs again. So same sources.\\n\\nThird tavily_search response for \"site:honda.com\" also shows same three URLs. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any honda.com URLs, so all sources are the same.\\n\\nThus, unique URLs are three: CMC, Universal Honda, BikeWale.\\n\\nNow, for each of these, we need to include all the summary text verbatim.\\n\\nBut in the first search, the CMC source summary was:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\"\\n\\nIn the third search\\'s Source 1, it says:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\"\\n\\nSo slightly different. So need to include both versions? Wait, but it\\'s the same URL. However, the summaries are different. So perhaps the same URL was accessed multiple times with different content? Or maybe the CMC Help Center page has different summaries depending on when it was accessed. But the instructions say to preserve all information verbatim, so if the same URL has different summary text in different responses, we need to include all instances.\\n\\nBut looking at the first search response for Source 1:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Honda CB350 Specs - CMC Help Center ---\\nURL: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThen in the third search, Source 1 has:\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\\n\\nSo different summary. So even though same URL, the summary text is different. So need to include both instances.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Universal Honda source in first search had a table, and in the third search, the same URL again has the same table.\\n\\nBikeWale in first search: summary says \"Oops! No suggestions found\" etc. But in the third search, same URL again, same summary.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n- For each unique URL, collect all the summary data from all the times it appeared in the search results, and include them verbatim.\\n\\nBut if the same URL has multiple summaries (like in different searches), include all summaries.\\n\\nNow, the steps to create the report:\\n\\n1. List all queries and tool calls made (the tavily_search queries, but not think_tool).\\n\\n2. Fully comprehensive findings: for each source, include all the summary text verbatim, with citations.\\n\\n3. Sources section listing each unique URL with citation number.\\n\\nBut according to the citation rules, each unique URL gets one citation number, regardless of how many times it appears in the search results. But in the findings, whenever the URL is mentioned, cite it with the number.\\n\\nWait, no. The citation rules say: Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text. End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers.\\n\\nSo for example, if the same URL appears in multiple places in the findings, each time cite the same number.\\n\\nBut in the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, we need to list all the information from the sources, each time citing the URL with its number.\\n\\nSo first, collect all unique URLs and assign numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\n2. https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\n3. https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nThat\\'s three unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, for each URL, in the findings section, include all the summary text from all instances.\\n\\nFor example, the first URL appeared in the first search\\'s Source 1 with the first summary, and in the third search\\'s Source 1 with the second summary. So in the findings section, when citing URL 1, we need to include both summaries.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the Universal Honda URL, it appeared in multiple searches with the same table (same summary), so include it once.\\n\\nBikeWale URL appeared multiple times with the same summary (the \"Oops! No suggestions found\" etc), so include it once.\\n\\nWait, but the BikeWale summary in the first search was:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nSpecifications of Honda CB350 | Features of CB350- BikeWale\\n===========================================================\\n\\n[ BikeWale ](https://www.bikewale.com/ \"BikeWale\")\\n\\n- Oops!

The user wants me to clean up the research findings for the Royal Enfield Classic 350, focusing on specs, performance, pricing, features, pros and cons. I need to preserve all relevant info verbatim, no summarizing or paraphrasing. Also, include all sources with citations.\\n\\nFirst, check the tool calls and search results. The user provided multiple search results from Tavily searches. I need to go through each source, check if it\\'s relevant, and then present them properly.\\n\\nLooking at the search results:\\n\\nFirst search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\". The results were:\\n\\n- Source 1: Wikipedia article on Royal Enfield Classic. But the summary shows it says \"may need to be rewritten\" and has some placeholder text. The URL is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic. But since Wikipedia might not be official, but it\\'s a reputable source. However, the summary is incomplete. The actual content might have some info, but the summary provided here is just a snippet from Wikipedia.\\n\\n- Source 2: PDF from royal-enfield.com with technical specs. The URL is https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf. The summary mentions \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style...\" and talks about the 350\\'s design, but the actual technical specs might be in the PDF. However, the summary provided here is the first part of the PDF.\\n\\n- Source 3: Another PDF from royal-enfield.com, Thailand spec sheet. URL: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf. Summary includes \"In 2021, we will learn to live again...\" and mentions the J platform, etc.\\n\\nSecond search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Smartprix page with price starting from ₹1,93,080 to ₹2,30,000. The URL is https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn.\\n\\n- Source 2: BikeWale page for Kolkata prices. Shows on-road price in Kolkata as ₹2,12,485 for Redditch variant. Ex-showroom, RTO, insurance details.\\n\\n- Source 3: Hindustan Times auto page for Classic 350. Summary is just a snippet with an image link.\\n\\nThird search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Cycle World\\'s 2022 Buyer\\'s Guide.

The tool calls were:\\n\\n1. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n2. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n3. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n4. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen, the findings from each search.\\n\\nNow, for the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, I need to list each source, quote the summary verbatim, and mention the URL. But according to the guidelines, include all relevant information, so the summaries as provided, even if they are incomplete. For example, Source 1 from first search is the Wikipedia entry with the \"may need to be rewritten\" note. But the user said \"preserve all relevant information\", so even if it\\'s a note about needing a rewrite, that\\'s part of the source\\'s content and should be included.\\n\\nBut also, the actual content of the PDFs. For example, Source 2 from first search has the PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary says \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style... The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2...\" etc. So I need to include that entire summary verbatim.\\n\\nSimilarly, Source 3 from first search\\'s summary: \"In 2021, we will learn to live again.

Royal Enfield Classic 350 is a Cruiser Bike powered by a Oil Cooled 349\" Wait, the last part says \"Oil Cooled 349\" which might be a typo for 349cc, but the summary is as given.\\n\\nBikeWale\\'s summary: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 On Road Price in Kolkata\" with tables showing ex-showroom, RTO, insurance, on-road price, and variants.\\n\\nHindustan Times has a summary with an image link, but the actual text might be minimal.\\n\\nThen the Cycle World Buyer\\'s Guide: \"2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 The world’s oldest motorcycle brand brings back the Classic with a modern powerplant.\" etc.\\n\\nMotorcycle News review: \"2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality\" by Dan Sutherland, with highlights and a table.\\n\\nNow, for the citation rules: Assign each unique URL a single citation number. Then list them in the Sources section with numbers.\\n\\nFirst, list all URLs from all sources. Let\\'s check duplicates.\\n\\nCheck all the URLs:\\n\\nFrom first search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\nSecond search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n- Source 3: https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\nThird search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n- Source 2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (duplicate of first search source 1)\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nFourth search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\" but the response shows same as third search\\'s source 1 and others. So the URLs would be same as before.\\n\\nSo unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (used in first search source 1, third search source 2)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nSo 8 unique URLs. Assign each a number.\\n\\nNow, in the findings section, for each source, when it\\'s mentioned, cite the number. But the output format requires \"List of Queries and Tool Calls Made\", then \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\", then \"List of All Relevant Sources\".\\n\\nSo first, list all the queries made:\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen in Fully Comprehensive Findings, present each source\\'s content verbatim, with the citation number. For example, if a source is from the first search, then when describing it, state [1] Source title: URL and then the summary.\\n\\nBut according to the guidelines: \"return inline citations for each source that the researcher found\". So when listing the findings, each part of the content should be cited with the number corresponding to the source.\\n\\nWait, the example says: \"These three sources all stated X [1][2][3]\".\\n\\nBut the exact instruction: \"In your report, you should return inline citations for each source that the researcher found.\"\\n\\nSo for each fact or piece of information from a source, cite the source number. But since the sources are the search results, each search result is a source. So each of the 8 URLs is a source, each gets a number. Then in the findings section, whenever a specific piece of info comes from a source, mark it with [number].\\n\\nBut in this case, the \"findings\" are the summaries from each search result. So perhaps the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section should list each search result\\'s summary verbatim, with the citation number next to it. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, structure the findings as follows: For each query, list the search results, each with their summary and citation.\\n\\nBut the output format says:\\n\\n**List of Queries and Tool Calls Made**\\n\\n**Fully Comprehensive Findings**\\n\\n**List of All Relevant Sources (with citations in the report)**\\n\\nSo in the Fully Comprehensive Findings, present all the information gathered, with inline citations. For example, if a source provides some specs, then state that info and cite the source.\\n\\nBut in the search results provided, each source\\'s summary is given. So for each of those summaries, they need to be included verbatim, and each should be cited with the source number.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the same URL might appear multiple times (like Wikipedia), but according to citation rules, assign each unique URL a single number.\\n\\nSo first, list all the unique URLs and assign them numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list them in order of first occurrence:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (from first search source 1)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf (first search source 2)\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf (first search source 3)\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn (second search source 1)\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/ (second search source 2)\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350 (second search source 3)\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/ (third search source 1)\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/ (third search source 3)\\n\\nSo these 8 unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, for each search result (i.e., each entry in the tool responses), present the summary verbatim, and note which source it is with the citation number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nFrom the first tool call (\"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"), the results were:\\n\\nSource 1: Wikipedia article. The summary includes \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia... [rest of the summary]\". So in findings, write that text and cite [1].\\n\\nSource 2: The PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary text: \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style. The Classic 350. The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2—and this perfectly-proportioned silhouette has been in fashion ever since.

This is from source [2].\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo the Fully Comprehensive Findings should list all these summaries, each with the citation number.\\n\\nThen the Sources section lists all 8 URLs with their numbers.\\n\\nBut the user said \"preserve all relevant information verbatim\". So even if a source is a Wikipedia article that says \"may need to be rewritten\", we have to include that exact text.\\n\\nLet\\'s check the exact text of each source\\'s summary as provided in the tool responses.\\n\\nFor example, first search\\'s Source 1:\\n\\n\"--- SOURCE 1: Royal Enfield Classic - Wikipedia --- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic SUMMARY: [Jump to content](#bodyContent) # Royal Enfield Classic * [हिन्दी](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AB%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95 \"रॉयल एनफील्ड क्लासिक – Hindi\") [Edit links](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q30636956#sitelinks-wikipedia \"Edit interlanguage links\") From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Motorcycle model |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | This article **may need to be rewritten** to comply with Wikipedia\\'s [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

So the exact text from each SOURCE in the tool responses should be included.\\n\\nSo for example, in the tool call responses, each source is listed as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo in the cleaned report, I need to take that exact structure, but cite it properly.\\n\\nBut the guidelines say: \"preserve all of the relevant statements and information that the researcher has gathered.

The \"Tool Call Filtering\" says to exclude think_tool calls, but include tavily_search results.\\n\\nThe existing messages contain the tool_call responses. Each search result is presented as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo the cleaned report should take all the SOURCE entries from the search results, and present them in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, with the URL and summary.\\n\\nBut to do that properly, for each SOURCE in the tool responses, take the URL and SUMMARY, and present them with the citation number.\\n\\nBut the user wants inline citations, so when a specific fact is mentioned in the findings, cite the source. However, in this case, the findings are the raw summaries from the search results.

The user wants me to clean up the research findings for the Royal Enfield Classic 350, focusing on specs, performance, pricing, features, pros and cons. I need to preserve all relevant info verbatim, no summarizing or paraphrasing. Also, include all sources with citations.\\n\\nFirst, check the tool calls and search results. The user provided multiple search results from Tavily searches. I need to go through each source, check if it\\'s relevant, and then present them properly.\\n\\nLooking at the search results:\\n\\nFirst search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\". The results were:\\n\\n- Source 1: Wikipedia article on Royal Enfield Classic. But the summary shows it says \"may need to be rewritten\" and has some placeholder text. The URL is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic. But since Wikipedia might not be official, but it\\'s a reputable source. However, the summary is incomplete. The actual content might have some info, but the summary provided here is just a snippet from Wikipedia.\\n\\n- Source 2: PDF from royal-enfield.com with technical specs. The URL is https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf. The summary mentions \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style...\" and talks about the 350\\'s design, but the actual technical specs might be in the PDF. However, the summary provided here is the first part of the PDF.\\n\\n- Source 3: Another PDF from royal-enfield.com, Thailand spec sheet. URL: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf. Summary includes \"In 2021, we will learn to live again...\" and mentions the J platform, etc.\\n\\nSecond search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Smartprix page with price starting from ₹1,93,080 to ₹2,30,000. The URL is https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn.\\n\\n- Source 2: BikeWale page for Kolkata prices. Shows on-road price in Kolkata as ₹2,12,485 for Redditch variant. Ex-showroom, RTO, insurance details.\\n\\n- Source 3: Hindustan Times auto page for Classic 350. Summary is just a snippet with an image link.\\n\\nThird search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Cycle World\\'s 2022 Buyer\\'s Guide. URL: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/. Summary mentions \"The world’s oldest motorcycle brand brings back the Classic with a modern powerplant.\"\\n\\n- Source 2: Wikipedia again, same as before.\\n\\n- Source 3: Motorcycle News review. URL: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/. Summary has \"2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality\" by Dan Sutherland.\\n\\nFourth search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\". But the results might be the same as the previous ones. Wait, the last search was \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\", but in the provided messages, the last tool call was \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\", but the response shows the same as SOURCE 1 from the third search (Cycle World Buyer\\'s Guide) and others.\\n\\nNow, the task is to present all these sources, preserving verbatim the info they provided, with citations.\\n\\nFirst, list all the queries made during the research. The tool calls were:\\n\\n1. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n2. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n3. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n4. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen, the findings from each search.\\n\\nNow, for the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, I need to list each source, quote the summary verbatim, and mention the URL. But according to the guidelines, include all relevant information, so the summaries as provided, even if they are incomplete. For example, Source 1 from first search is the Wikipedia entry with the \"may need to be rewritten\" note. But the user said \"preserve all relevant information\", so even if it\\'s a note about needing a rewrite, that\\'s part of the source\\'s content and should be included.\\n\\nBut also, the actual content of the PDFs. For example, Source 2 from first search has the PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary says \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style... The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2...\" etc. So I need to include that entire summary verbatim.\\n\\nSimilarly, Source 3 from first search\\'s summary: \"In 2021, we will learn to live again. The All-New Classic 350 has been made for this journey. Efortless power and precise control in perfect harmony. Impeccably crafted lines and an instantly recognisable heartbeat. The Classic 350.

LIKE IT’S THE FIRST TIME AGAIN. IT’S TIME TO SEE THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD CLEARER THAN EVER BEFORE. TO FEEL THE MOST ALIVE YOU’VE EVER FELT. BREATHE IN. BREATHE OUT. HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH. TAKE IT ALL IN. BE REBORN. The All-New Classic 350 continues to embody the traditions and craftsmanship of the past as it is reborn on the new J platform. Inspired by the post war G2 model, frst born in 2008, the Classic 350 of 2021 continues to celebrate the timeless aesthetic through the curvaceous mudguards and teardrop fuel tank, hallmark casquette headlamp, enduring lines of the crankcase covers...\"\\n\\nSo all of that needs to be included verbatim.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the price searches, the Smartprix entry says \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price in India starts from ₹1,93,080 and goes upto ₹2,30,000. Royal Enfield Classic 350 is a Cruiser Bike powered by a Oil Cooled 349\" Wait, the last part says \"Oil Cooled 349\" which might be a typo for 349cc, but the summary is as given.\\n\\nBikeWale\\'s summary: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 On Road Price in Kolkata\" with tables showing ex-showroom, RTO, insurance, on-road price, and variants.\\n\\nHindustan Times has a summary with an image link, but the actual text might be minimal.\\n\\nThen the Cycle World Buyer\\'s Guide: \"2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 The world’s oldest motorcycle brand brings back the Classic with a modern powerplant.\" etc.\\n\\nMotorcycle News review: \"2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality\" by Dan Sutherland, with highlights and a table.\\n\\nNow, for the citation rules: Assign each unique URL a single citation number. Then list them in the Sources section with numbers.\\n\\nFirst, list all URLs from all sources. Let\\'s check duplicates.\\n\\nCheck all the URLs:\\n\\nFrom first search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\nSecond search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n- Source 3: https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\nThird search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n- Source 2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (duplicate of first search source 1)\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nFourth search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\" but the response shows same as third search\\'s source 1 and others. So the URLs would be same as before.\\n\\nSo unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (used in first search source 1, third search source 2)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nSo 8 unique URLs. Assign each a number.\\n\\nNow, in the findings section, for each source, when it\\'s mentioned, cite the number. But the output format requires \"List of Queries and Tool Calls Made\", then \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\", then \"List of All Relevant Sources\".\\n\\nSo first, list all the queries made:\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen in Fully Comprehensive Findings, present each source\\'s content verbatim, with the citation number. For example, if a source is from the first search, then when describing it, state [1] Source title: URL and then the summary.\\n\\nBut according to the guidelines: \"return inline citations for each source that the researcher found\". So when listing the findings, each part of the content should be cited with the number corresponding to the source.\\n\\nWait, the example says: \"These three sources all stated X [1][2][3]\".\\n\\nBut the exact instruction: \"In your report, you should return inline citations for each source that the researcher found.\"\\n\\nSo for each fact or piece of information from a source, cite the source number. But since the sources are the search results, each search result is a source. So each of the 8 URLs is a source, each gets a number. Then in the findings section, whenever a specific piece of info comes from a source, mark it with [number].\\n\\nBut in this case, the \"findings\" are the summaries from each search result. So perhaps the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section should list each search result\\'s summary verbatim, with the citation number next to it. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, structure the findings as follows: For each query, list the search results, each with their summary and citation.\\n\\nBut the output format says:\\n\\n**List of Queries and Tool Calls Made**\\n\\n**Fully Comprehensive Findings**\\n\\n**List of All Relevant Sources (with citations in the report)**\\n\\nSo in the Fully Comprehensive Findings, present all the information gathered, with inline citations. For example, if a source provides some specs, then state that info and cite the source.\\n\\nBut in the search results provided, each source\\'s summary is given. So for each of those summaries, they need to be included verbatim, and each should be cited with the source number.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the same URL might appear multiple times (like Wikipedia), but according to citation rules, assign each unique URL a single number.\\n\\nSo first, list all the unique URLs and assign them numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list them in order of first occurrence:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (from first search source 1)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf (first search source 2)\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf (first search source 3)\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn (second search source 1)\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/ (second search source 2)\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350 (second search source 3)\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/ (third search source 1)\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/ (third search source 3)\\n\\nSo these 8 unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, for each search result (i.e., each entry in the tool responses), present the summary verbatim, and note which source it is with the citation number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nFrom the first tool call (\"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"), the results were:\\n\\nSource 1: Wikipedia article. The summary includes \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia... [rest of the summary]\". So in findings, write that text and cite [1].\\n\\nSource 2: The PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary text: \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style. The Classic 350. The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2—and this perfectly-proportioned silhouette has been in fashion ever since. In its current avatar, the Classic continues to represent an era in which motorcycles had impeccable road manners and unforgettable style. From burnished bronze to desert blue, this thoroughbred motorcycle is available in seven striking new colourways inspired by its past, present and future. TRENDING SINCE 1950 Unmatched design. Unmistakable style. Unrivalled craftsmanship. With its rare blend of character and artistry, the Classic 350 stands out in an era of mass production.

This is from source [2].\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo the Fully Comprehensive Findings should list all these summaries, each with the citation number.\\n\\nThen the Sources section lists all 8 URLs with their numbers.\\n\\nBut the user said \"preserve all relevant information verbatim\". So even if a source is a Wikipedia article that says \"may need to be rewritten\", we have to include that exact text.\\n\\nLet\\'s check the exact text of each source\\'s summary as provided in the tool responses.\\n\\nFor example, first search\\'s Source 1:\\n\\n\"--- SOURCE 1: Royal Enfield Classic - Wikipedia --- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic SUMMARY: [Jump to content](#bodyContent) # Royal Enfield Classic * [हिन्दी](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AB%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95 \"रॉयल एनफील्ड क्लासिक – Hindi\") [Edit links](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q30636956#sitelinks-wikipedia \"Edit interlanguage links\") From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Motorcycle model |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | This article **may need to be rewritten** to comply with Wikipedia\\'s [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

So the exact text from each SOURCE in the tool responses should be included.\\n\\nSo for example, in the tool call responses, each source is listed as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo in the cleaned report, I need to take that exact structure, but cite it properly.\\n\\nBut the guidelines say: \"preserve all of the relevant statements and information that the researcher has gathered. For context, today\\'s date is Mon Oct 6, 2025.\"\\n\\nSo the actual output should include all the SOURCE entries as they were in the tool responses, but perhaps cleaned up by removing any irrelevant parts like the \"--- SOURCE X: ... ---\" headers and just present the content with citations.\\n\\nWait, but the task is to clean up the findings, but preserve all relevant info verbatim. The \"Tool Call Filtering\" says to exclude think_tool calls, but include tavily_search results.\\n\\nThe existing messages contain the tool_call responses. Each search result is presented as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo the cleaned report should take all the SOURCE entries from the search results, and present them in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, with the URL and summary.\\n\\nBut to do that properly, for each SOURCE in the tool responses, take the URL and SUMMARY, and present them with the citation number.\\n\\nBut the user wants inline citations, so when a specific fact is mentioned in the findings, cite the source. However, in this case, the findings are the raw summaries from the search results. So perhaps the best way is to list each source\\'s summary as a block, with the citation number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n\\n[Jump to content](#bodyContent)\\n\\n# Royal Enfield Classic\\n\\n* [हिन्दी](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AB%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95 \"रॉयल एनफील्ड क्लासिक – Hindi\")\\n\\n[Edit links](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q30636956#sitelinks-wikipedia \"Edit interlanguage links\")\\n\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\n\\nMotorcycle model\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n|  | This article **may need to be rewritten** to comply with Wikipedia\\'s [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

       "  HumanMessage(content='Here is the final report: This report provides a detailed comparison between the Royal Enfield Classic 350 and the Honda CB 350, drawing on official manufacturer sources and reputable review platforms to cover specifications, performance metrics, pricing, features, pros and cons, and overall suitability. The analysis considers all relevant dimensions to offer a comprehensive overview of these two popular motorcycles.\\n\\n## Royal Enfield Classic 350 Overview\\n\\nThe Royal Enfield Classic 350 is presented as a motorcycle deeply rooted in heritage and timeless aesthetics, tracing its lineage back to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2 model [2][3]. It embodies the traditions and craftsmanship of the past while being reborn on the modern J platform in 2021 [3]. The design is characterized by its perfectly-proportioned silhouette, curvaceous mudguards, teardrop fuel tank, and hallmark casquette headlamp [2][3]. The motorcycle is described as having \"unwavering style\" and is available in seven striking new colorways inspired by its history [2]. It is highlighted for its blend of modern engineering and traditional handcrafting, resulting in an \"indomitable DNA\" and a deep, throaty exhaust note [2]. Reviewers note its \"character styling, and quality\" and \"just enough power\" for its segment [8].\\n\\n## Honda CB 350 Overview\\n\\nThe Honda CB 350, based on the research findings, is presented primarily through its technical specifications and pricing. It features a 325.6cc OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin engine with a bore/stroke of 64 mm × 50.6 mm [9]. Another source indicates an engine displacement of 348.36 CC [10]. The motorcycle is equipped with a 5-speed transmission, double disc brakes, and a multiplate wet clutch [9][10]. Its kerb weight is listed as 187 kg, with a self-start only mechanism [10]. Performance figures vary across sources, with one stating 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, and a top speed of 110 mph (approximately 177 km/h) [9], while another lists 21.07 PS @ 5500 rpm [10]. The research did not yield extensive details on its design philosophy or specific pros and cons from review platforms, with one search result indicating no suggestions found for specifications and features [11].\\n\\n## Detailed Comparison\\n\\n### Specifications\\n\\n**Engine and Performance:**\\nThe Royal Enfield Classic 350 is powered by a 349cc oil-cooled engine, built on the new J platform [3][4]. While specific power and torque figures were not explicitly provided in the summaries for the Classic 350, reviews suggest it offers \"just enough power\" [8] and \"effortless power and precise control\" [3].\\n\\nFor the Honda CB 350, the engine displacement is noted as 325.6cc OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin [9], with another source specifying 348.36 CC [10]. Power figures show a notable discrepancy: one source states 36 bhp, 2.55 kg·m torque, and a top speed of 110 mph (approximately 177 km/h) [9], while another lists 21.07 PS @ 5500 rpm [10]. It\\'s important to note that 36 bhp is significantly higher than 21.07 PS (approximately 20.78 bhp), indicating different models or measurement standards, or a data inconsistency in the sources. The Honda CB 350 features a 5-speed transmission [9][10].\\n\\n**Chassis, Brakes, and Weight:**\\nThe Royal Enfield Classic 350\\'s \"signature stance\" includes an upright riding position [2]. The Redditch variant is equipped with disc brakes and spoke wheels [5]. Specific weight figures for the Classic 350 were not available in the provided research summaries.\\n\\nThe Honda CB 350 features double disc brakes and a multiplate wet clutch [10]. Its kerb weight is cited as 187 kg [10]. Another source provides a dry weight of 328 lb (approximately 148.8 kg) [9], which is a significant difference from the kerb weight, possibly due to different measurement standards (dry vs. kerb/wet weight).\\n\\n### Pricing\\n\\n**Royal Enfield Classic 350:**\\nIn India, the price for the Royal Enfield Classic 350 starts from ₹1,93,080 and can go up to ₹2,30,000 [4]. The on-road price in Kolkata for the Classic 350 Redditch variant is ₹2,12,485, which includes an ex-showroom price of ₹1,81,118, RTO charges of ₹19,612, and comprehensive insurance of ₹11,755 [5].\\n\\n**Honda CB 350:**\\nThe ex-showroom prices for the Honda CB 350 variants are as follows [10]:\\n*   Honda CB350 DLX (Petrol): ₹197,806\\n*   Honda CB350 DLX Pro (Petrol): ₹200,866\\n*   Honda CB350C Special Edition (Petrol): ₹201,900\\n\\nBased on these figures, both motorcycles fall within a similar price bracket, with the Honda CB 350\\'s ex-showroom prices being slightly higher for its base variants compared to the starting price of the Classic 350.\\n\\n### Features and Design\\n\\n**Royal Enfield Classic 350:**\\nThe Classic 350 is celebrated for its distinctive design, drawing inspiration from the post-war G2 model [3]. Key design elements include curvaceous mudguards, a teardrop fuel tank, and a hallmark casquette headlamp [3]. It is available in various \"gleaming colours\" and is characterized by its \"unmistakable style\" and \"unrivalled craftsmanship,\" blending modern engineering with traditional handcrafting [2]. The motorcycle also features a \"deep, throaty exhaust note\" [2].\\n\\n**Honda CB 350:**\\nThe provided research for the Honda CB 350 primarily focuses on technical specifications. Features mentioned include its double disc braking system, multiplate wet clutch, and self-start only ignition [10]. There were no explicit descriptions of its aesthetic design or unique styling features in the summarized findings. The search for features on a reputable platform resulted in an \"Oops! No suggestions found\" page [11], limiting insights into its user-perceived features.\\n\\n### Pros and Cons / Overall Suitability\\n\\n**Royal Enfield Classic 350:**\\n*   **Pros:** Strong emphasis on heritage, \"timeless aesthetic,\" \"character styling, and quality\" [2][3][8]. It offers an \"instantly recognisable heartbeat\" and enduring appeal [3][2]. The motorcycle is designed for effortless power and precise control, suitable for a journey of self-discovery [3]. Its blend of modern engineering and traditional handcrafting creates a unique appeal [2].\\n*   **Cons:** While described as having \"just enough power\" [8], this might be a con for riders seeking more spirited performance. The research did not explicitly detail other cons from review platforms. The Wikipedia source noted it \"may need to be rewritten\" [1], which is a limitation of the source itself, not the bike.\\n*   **Suitability:** The Classic 350 appears well-suited for riders who appreciate classic styling, a comfortable upright riding position, and a relaxed, characterful riding experience. It appeals to those who value heritage and a distinctive presence on the road over outright speed or cutting-edge technology.\\n\\n**Honda CB 350:**\\n*   **Pros:** Based on the available specifications, it offers a robust engine and modern braking (double disc) [9][10]. The kerb weight of 187 kg [10] (or 328 lb dry weight [9]) suggests a manageable size. The multiple variants offer choices in pricing and potentially features [10].\\n*   **Cons:** The research did not provide specific pros and cons from reputable reviews, limiting a direct comparison in this aspect. The conflicting power and weight figures from different sources [9][10] could be a point of confusion for potential buyers seeking precise information. The lack of detailed design descriptions also makes it harder to assess its aesthetic appeal in comparison to the Classic 350.\\n*   **Suitability:** The Honda CB 350, with its specifications, appears to be a contender for riders looking for a reliable, moderately powerful motorcycle in the 350cc segment. Its \"self-start only\" feature suggests modern convenience. Without more detailed review insights, it\\'s challenging to pinpoint its exact niche, but it likely targets riders seeking a blend of Honda\\'s reliability with a classic-inspired form factor, though the research didn\\'t highlight its classic design elements as strongly as for the Royal Enfield.\\n\\nIn summary, the Royal Enfield Classic 350 strongly leverages its heritage and distinctive aesthetic, offering a characterful and classic riding experience. The Honda CB 350, while presenting competitive specifications and pricing, lacks detailed qualitative insights from the provided research, making it harder to fully assess its unique appeal and riding experience in comparison.\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] Royal Enfield Classic - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n[2] Royal Enfield Classic 350 Technical Specifications: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n[3] Specification-classic-350: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n[4] Royal Enfield Classic 350 Price in India 2025: https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n[5] Royal Enfield Classic 350 On Road Price in Kolkata: https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n[6] Royal Enfield Classic 350 - On-Road Price, Specs, Reviews: https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n[7] 2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 Buyer\\'s Guide: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n[8] 2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n[9] Honda CB350 Specs - CMC Help Center: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n[10] Honda CB350 Specs & Features, Configurations, Dimensions: https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n[11] Specifications & Features of Honda CB350 - BikeWale: https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='4e5c9e60-6b4a-48e3-b647-0dca182ac591')],\n",

The user wants me to clean up the research findings for the Royal Enfield Classic 350, focusing on specs, performance, pricing, features, pros and cons. I need to preserve all relevant info verbatim, no summarizing or paraphrasing. Also, include all sources with citations.\\n\\nFirst, check the tool calls and search results. The user provided multiple search results from Tavily searches. I need to go through each source, check if it\\'s relevant, and then present them properly.\\n\\nLooking at the search results:\\n\\nFirst search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\". The results were:\\n\\n- Source 1: Wikipedia article on Royal Enfield Classic. But the summary shows it says \"may need to be rewritten\" and has some placeholder text. The URL is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic. But since Wikipedia might not be official, but it\\'s a reputable source. However, the summary is incomplete. The actual content might have some info, but the summary provided here is just a snippet from Wikipedia.\\n\\n- Source 2: PDF from royal-enfield.com with technical specs. The URL is https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf. The summary mentions \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style...\" and talks about the 350\\'s design, but the actual technical specs might be in the PDF. However, the summary provided here is the first part of the PDF.\\n\\n- Source 3: Another PDF from royal-enfield.com, Thailand spec sheet. URL: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf. Summary includes \"In 2021, we will learn to live again...\" and mentions the J platform, etc.\\n\\nSecond search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Smartprix page with price starting from ₹1,93,080 to ₹2,30,000. The URL is https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn.\\n\\n- Source 2: BikeWale page for Kolkata prices. Shows on-road price in Kolkata as ₹2,12,485 for Redditch variant. Ex-showroom, RTO, insurance details.\\n\\n- Source 3: Hindustan Times auto page for Classic 350. Summary is just a snippet with an image link.\\n\\nThird search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Cycle World\\'s 2022 Buyer\\'s Guide.

Summary has \"2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality\" by Dan Sutherland.\\n\\nFourth search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\". But the results might be the same as the previous ones. Wait, the last search was \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\", but in the provided messages, the last tool call was \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\", but the response shows the same as SOURCE 1 from the third search (Cycle World Buyer\\'s Guide) and others.\\n\\nNow, the task is to present all these sources, preserving verbatim the info they provided, with citations.\\n\\nFirst, list all the queries made during the research. The tool calls were:\\n\\n1. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n2. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n3. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n4. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen, the findings from each search.\\n\\nNow, for the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, I need to list each source, quote the summary verbatim, and mention the URL. But according to the guidelines, include all relevant information, so the summaries as provided, even if they are incomplete. For example, Source 1 from first search is the Wikipedia entry with the \"may need to be rewritten\" note. But the user said \"preserve all relevant information\", so even if it\\'s a note about needing a rewrite, that\\'s part of the source\\'s content and should be included.\\n\\nBut also, the actual content of the PDFs. For example, Source 2 from first search has the PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary says \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style... The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2...\" etc. So I need to include that entire summary verbatim.\\n\\nSimilarly, Source 3 from first search\\'s summary: \"In 2021, we will learn to live again. The All-New Classic 350 has been made for this journey. Efortless power and precise control in perfect harmony. Impeccably crafted lines and an instantly recognisable heartbeat. The Classic 350.

Royal Enfield Classic 350 is a Cruiser Bike powered by a Oil Cooled 349\" Wait, the last part says \"Oil Cooled 349\" which might be a typo for 349cc, but the summary is as given.\\n\\nBikeWale\\'s summary: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 On Road Price in Kolkata\" with tables showing ex-showroom, RTO, insurance, on-road price, and variants.\\n\\nHindustan Times has a summary with an image link, but the actual text might be minimal.\\n\\nThen the Cycle World Buyer\\'s Guide: \"2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 The world’s oldest motorcycle brand brings back the Classic with a modern powerplant.\" etc.\\n\\nMotorcycle News review: \"2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality\" by Dan Sutherland, with highlights and a table.\\n\\nNow, for the citation rules: Assign each unique URL a single citation number. Then list them in the Sources section with numbers.\\n\\nFirst, list all URLs from all sources. Let\\'s check duplicates.\\n\\nCheck all the URLs:\\n\\nFrom first search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\nSecond search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n- Source 3: https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\nThird search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n- Source 2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (duplicate of first search source 1)\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nFourth search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\" but the response shows same as third search\\'s source 1 and others. So the URLs would be same as before.\\n\\nSo unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (used in first search source 1, third search source 2)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nSo 8 unique URLs. Assign each a number.\\n\\nNow, in the findings section, for each source, when it\\'s mentioned, cite the number. But the output format requires \"List of Queries and Tool Calls Made\", then \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\", then \"List of All Relevant Sources\".\\n\\nSo first, list all the queries made:\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen in Fully Comprehensive Findings, present each source\\'s content verbatim, with the citation number. For example, if a source is from the first search, then when describing it, state [1] Source title: URL and then the summary.\\n\\nBut according to the guidelines: \"return inline citations for each source that the researcher found\". So when listing the findings, each part of the content should be cited with the number corresponding to the source.\\n\\nWait, the example says: \"These three sources all stated X [1][2][3]\".\\n\\nBut the exact instruction: \"In your report, you should return inline citations for each source that the researcher found.\"\\n\\nSo for each fact or piece of information from a source, cite the source number. But since the sources are the search results, each search result is a source. So each of the 8 URLs is a source, each gets a number. Then in the findings section, whenever a specific piece of info comes from a source, mark it with [number].\\n\\nBut in this case, the \"findings\" are the summaries from each search result. So perhaps the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section should list each search result\\'s summary verbatim, with the citation number next to it. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, structure the findings as follows: For each query, list the search results, each with their summary and citation.\\n\\nBut the output format says:\\n\\n**List of Queries and Tool Calls Made**\\n\\n**Fully Comprehensive Findings**\\n\\n**List of All Relevant Sources (with citations in the report)**\\n\\nSo in the Fully Comprehensive Findings, present all the information gathered, with inline citations. For example, if a source provides some specs, then state that info and cite the source.\\n\\nBut in the search results provided, each source\\'s summary is given. So for each of those summaries, they need to be included verbatim, and each should be cited with the source number.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the same URL might appear multiple times (like Wikipedia), but according to citation rules, assign each unique URL a single number.\\n\\nSo first, list all the unique URLs and assign them numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list them in order of first occurrence:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (from first search source 1)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf (first search source 2)\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf (first search source 3)\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn (second search source 1)\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/ (second search source 2)\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350 (second search source 3)\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/ (third search source 1)\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/ (third search source 3)\\n\\nSo these 8 unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, for each search result (i.e., each entry in the tool responses), present the summary verbatim, and note which source it is with the citation number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nFrom the first tool call (\"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"), the results were:\\n\\nSource 1: Wikipedia article. The summary includes \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia... [rest of the summary]\". So in findings, write that text and cite [1].\\n\\nSource 2: The PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary text: \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style. The Classic 350. The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2—and this perfectly-proportioned silhouette has been in fashion ever since. In its current avatar, the Classic continues to represent an era in which motorcycles had impeccable road manners and unforgettable style. From burnished bronze to desert blue, this thoroughbred motorcycle is available in seven striking new colourways inspired by its past, present and future. TRENDING SINCE 1950 Unmatched design. Unmistakable style. Unrivalled craftsmanship. With its rare blend of character and artistry, the Classic 350 stands out in an era of mass production. Each machine is a meld of modern engineering and traditional handcrafting, giving the motorcycle its indomitable DNA.

This is from source [2].\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo the Fully Comprehensive Findings should list all these summaries, each with the citation number.\\n\\nThen the Sources section lists all 8 URLs with their numbers.\\n\\nBut the user said \"preserve all relevant information verbatim\". So even if a source is a Wikipedia article that says \"may need to be rewritten\", we have to include that exact text.\\n\\nLet\\'s check the exact text of each source\\'s summary as provided in the tool responses.\\n\\nFor example, first search\\'s Source 1:\\n\\n\"--- SOURCE 1: Royal Enfield Classic - Wikipedia --- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic SUMMARY: [Jump to content](#bodyContent) # Royal Enfield Classic * [हिन्दी](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AB%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95 \"रॉयल एनफील्ड क्लासिक – Hindi\") [Edit links](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q30636956#sitelinks-wikipedia \"Edit interlanguage links\") From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Motorcycle model |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | This article **may need to be rewritten** to comply with Wikipedia\\'s [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

So the exact text from each SOURCE in the tool responses should be included.\\n\\nSo for example, in the tool call responses, each source is listed as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo in the cleaned report, I need to take that exact structure, but cite it properly.\\n\\nBut the guidelines say: \"preserve all of the relevant statements and information that the researcher has gathered. For context, today\\'s date is Mon Oct 6, 2025.\"\\n\\nSo the actual output should include all the SOURCE entries as they were in the tool responses, but perhaps cleaned up by removing any irrelevant parts like the \"--- SOURCE X: ... ---\" headers and just present the content with citations.\\n\\nWait, but the task is to clean up the findings, but preserve all relevant info verbatim. The \"Tool Call Filtering\" says to exclude think_tool calls, but include tavily_search results.\\n\\nThe existing messages contain the tool_call responses. Each search result is presented as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo the cleaned report should take all the SOURCE entries from the search results, and present them in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, with the URL and summary.\\n\\nBut to do that properly, for each SOURCE in the tool responses, take the URL and SUMMARY, and present them with the citation number.\\n\\nBut the user wants inline citations, so when a specific fact is mentioned in the findings, cite the source. However, in this case, the findings are the raw summaries from the search results. So perhaps the best way is to list each source\\'s summary as a block, with the citation number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n\\n[Jump to content](#bodyContent)\\n\\n# Royal Enfield Classic\\n\\n* [हिन्दी](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AB%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95 \"रॉयल एनफील्ड क्लासिक – Hindi\")\\n\\n[Edit links](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q30636956#sitelinks-wikipedia \"Edit interlanguage links\")\\n\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\n\\nMotorcycle model\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n|  | This article **may need to be rewritten** to comply with Wikipedia\\'s [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

       "  ToolMessage(content='Okay, let\\'s tackle this. The user wants me to clean up the research findings for the Honda CB 350, preserving all relevant info verbatim. First, I need to check the messages provided and see what sources were gathered.\\n\\nLooking at the tool calls and responses. The user asked for detailed info on Honda CB 350 specs, performance, pricing, features, pros/cons, using official and reputable sources.\\n\\nFirst, there were three tool calls. The first was \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\" which returned three sources. Then a think_tool reflection about needing more official info, then another search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", and another for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\". But the responses to those searches are in the messages.\\n\\nWait, the last two searches might not have actual content. Let me check the search results.\\n\\nFirst search (query: \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\"):\\n\\n- Source 1: CMC Help Center, URL https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs. Summary says 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp, torque, top speed 110mph, 5-speed, dry weight 328 lb.\\n\\n- Source 2: Universal Honda, URL https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html. Shows a table with variants, prices, engine displacement 348.36 CC, power 21.07 PS @5500 rpm, etc.\\n\\n- Source 3: BikeWale, URL https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/. But the summary shows \"Oops! No suggestions found\" and some city selection stuff. Wait, that seems like a broken page. Maybe the actual content wasn\\'t retrieved properly. But the user said to preserve all, so even if it\\'s a partial or error message, it should be included verbatim.\\n\\nThen the think_tool response was internal, so it should be excluded as per the instructions.\\n\\nNext tool call was \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", which returned three sources again. Wait, looking at the first source again: same as Source 1 from before? The URL is the same. The summary is similar. Then Source 2 is BikeWale again (same as before), Source 3 is Universal Honda again. So maybe duplicate sources.\\n\\nWait the third search was \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\" but the response was not shown? Wait no, the user provided the tool call and the response. Let\\'s check.\\n\\nAfter the first search, the response had three sources. Then the think_tool reflection. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", which gave three sources again. The first source in that response is the same CMC Help Center URL. Then BikeWale again, then Universal Honda again. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\". Let\\'s check the response for that.\\n\\nWait, in the messages provided, after the second tavily_search (site:honda.co.in), the response was three sources, but then there\\'s another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", but the response isn\\'t shown. Wait the last part of the user\\'s message says:\\n\\n\" All above messages are about research conducted by an AI Researcher for the following research topic: [...] Your task is to clean up these research findings [...]\"\\n\\nSo in the messages, the last tool call was \"tavily_search\" with \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", but the \"dall\" response is empty?

Let me check the structure.\\n\\nThe history starts with the initial user query. Then the assistant did a tavily_search for \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\", got three sources. Then a think_tool reflection. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", which returned three sources (but maybe duplicates). Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", and then a response. Wait, looking at the messages:\\n\\nIn the user\\'s message that\\'s the current query, the history includes:\\n\\n- First user message: the task.\\n\\n- Then the assistant\\'s first tool call: tavily_search with \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\", then the response (three sources).\\n\\n- Then the assistant did a think_tool.\\n\\n- Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", response with three sources.\\n\\n- Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", and then a response, but in the provided history, the response for that might not be shown? Wait, the user provided all messages. Let me check.\\n\\nLooking at the user\\'s input:\\n\\nThe user provided all the messages. Let\\'s parse them.\\n\\nFirst, the initial user message is the task. Then the AI assistant has a series of messages:\\n\\n1. The first tool call (tavily_search with query \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\")\\n\\n2. The response from that tool call (three sources: CMC Help Center, Universal Honda, BikeWale)\\n\\n3. Then a think_tool call with reflection.\\n\\n4. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", with response (three sources, same URLs as before?)\\n\\n5. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", and then a response.\\n\\nWait, but in the user\\'s input, the last part shows:\\n\\nAfter the second tavily_search (site:honda.co.in), the response is listed as three sources (same as before), then another tool call: tavily_search with \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", but the response for that is not shown.

None of the results are from honda.com. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any results from honda.com. That\\'s important to note.\\n\\nNow, the task is to clean up all the relevant information from these sources, preserving verbatim, excluding think_tool calls.\\n\\nSo first, list all the tool calls that are relevant. The tavily_search calls and their responses, but exclude the think_tool.\\n\\nSo the relevant tool responses are:\\n\\n1. First tavily_search (query \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\") returned three sources.\\n\\n2. Second tavily_search (query \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\") returned three sources.\\n\\n3. Third tavily_search (query \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\") returned three sources.\\n\\nBut all these sources have overlapping URLs. For example, the CMC Help Center URL is repeated in all three searches.\\n\\nNow, the task is to list all these sources, but without duplicates. However, the instruction says to preserve all information, including duplicates if they are in the sources. But the citation rules say to assign each unique URL a single citation number. So even if the same URL appears multiple times in different searches, it should be cited once.\\n\\nSo first, collect all the unique URLs from all the tool responses.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all URLs from the search results:\\n\\nFrom first tavily_search response:\\n\\nSource 1: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSource 2: https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\nSource 3: https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nSecond tavily_search response:\\n\\nSame three URLs again. So same sources.\\n\\nThird tavily_search response for \"site:honda.com\" also shows same three URLs. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any honda.com URLs, so all sources are the same.\\n\\nThus, unique URLs are three: CMC, Universal Honda, BikeWale.\\n\\nNow, for each of these, we need to include all the summary text verbatim.\\n\\nBut in the first search, the CMC source summary was:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\"\\n\\nIn the third search\\'s Source 1, it says:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\"\\n\\nSo slightly different. So need to include both versions? Wait, but it\\'s the same URL. However, the summaries are different. So perhaps the same URL was accessed multiple times with different content? Or maybe the CMC Help Center page has different summaries depending on when it was accessed. But the instructions say to preserve all information verbatim, so if the same URL has different summary text in different responses, we need to include all instances.\\n\\nBut looking at the first search response for Source 1:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Honda CB350 Specs - CMC Help Center ---\\nURL: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThen in the third search, Source 1 has:\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\\n\\nSo different summary. So even though same URL, the summary text is different. So need to include both instances.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Universal Honda source in first search had a table, and in the third search, the same URL again has the same table.\\n\\nBikeWale in first search: summary says \"Oops! No suggestions found\" etc. But in the third search, same URL again, same summary.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n- For each unique URL, collect all the summary data from all the times it appeared in the search results, and include them verbatim.\\n\\nBut if the same URL has multiple summaries (like in different searches), include all summaries.\\n\\nNow, the steps to create the report:\\n\\n1. List all queries and tool calls made (the tavily_search queries, but not think_tool).\\n\\n2. Fully comprehensive findings: for each source, include all the summary text verbatim, with citations.\\n\\n3. Sources section listing each unique URL with citation number.\\n\\nBut according to the citation rules, each unique URL gets one citation number, regardless of how many times it appears in the search results. But in the findings, whenever the URL is mentioned, cite it with the number.\\n\\nWait, no. The citation rules say: Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text. End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers.\\n\\nSo for example, if the same URL appears in multiple places in the findings, each time cite the same number.\\n\\nBut in the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, we need to list all the information from the sources, each time citing the URL with its number.\\n\\nSo first, collect all unique URLs and assign numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\n2. https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\n3. https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nThat\\'s three unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, for each URL, in the findings section, include all the summary text from all instances.\\n\\nFor example, the first URL appeared in the first search\\'s Source 1 with the first summary, and in the third search\\'s Source 1 with the second summary.

Each agent will be tasked with gathering information on specifications, performance, pricing, features, and pros and cons from official and reputable sources. This approach will be efficient and allow for a comprehensive comparison once the information is gathered.',\n",
       "  'Okay, let\\'s tackle this. The user wants me to clean up the research findings for the Royal Enfield Classic 350, focusing on specs, performance, pricing, features, pros and cons. I need to preserve all relevant info verbatim, no summarizing or paraphrasing. Also, include all sources with citations.\\n\\nFirst, check the tool calls and search results. The user provided multiple search results from Tavily searches. I need to go through each source, check if it\\'s relevant, and then present them properly.\\n\\nLooking at the search results:\\n\\nFirst search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\". The results were:\\n\\n- Source 1: Wikipedia article on Royal Enfield Classic. But the summary shows it says \"may need to be rewritten\" and has some placeholder text. The URL is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic. But since Wikipedia might not be official, but it\\'s a reputable source. However, the summary is incomplete. The actual content might have some info, but the summary provided here is just a snippet from Wikipedia.\\n\\n- Source 2: PDF from royal-enfield.com with technical specs. The URL is https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf. The summary mentions \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style...\" and talks about the 350\\'s design, but the actual technical specs might be in the PDF. However, the summary provided here is the first part of the PDF.\\n\\n- Source 3: Another PDF from royal-enfield.com, Thailand spec sheet. URL: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf. Summary includes \"In 2021, we will learn to live again...\" and mentions the J platform, etc.\\n\\nSecond search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Smartprix page with price starting from ₹1,93,080 to ₹2,30,000. The URL is https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn.\\n\\n- Source 2: BikeWale page for Kolkata prices. Shows on-road price in Kolkata as ₹2,12,485 for Redditch variant. Ex-showroom, RTO, insurance details.\\n\\n- Source 3: Hindustan Times auto page for Classic 350. Summary is just a snippet with an image link.\\n\\nThird search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\". Results:\\n\\n- Source 1: Cycle World\\'s 2022 Buyer\\'s Guide. URL: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/. Summary mentions \"The world’s oldest motorcycle brand brings back the Classic with a modern powerplant.\"\\n\\n- Source 2: Wikipedia again, same as before.\\n\\n- Source 3: Motorcycle News review. URL: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/. Summary has \"2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality\" by Dan Sutherland.\\n\\nFourth search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\". But the results might be the same as the previous ones. Wait, the last search was \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\", but in the provided messages, the last tool call was \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\", but the response shows the same as SOURCE 1 from the third search (Cycle World Buyer\\'s Guide) and others.\\n\\nNow, the task is to present all these sources, preserving verbatim the info they provided, with citations.\\n\\nFirst, list all the queries made during the research. The tool calls were:\\n\\n1. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n2. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n3. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n4. \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen, the findings from each search.\\n\\nNow, for the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, I need to list each source, quote the summary verbatim, and mention the URL. But according to the guidelines, include all relevant information, so the summaries as provided, even if they are incomplete. For example, Source 1 from first search is the Wikipedia entry with the \"may need to be rewritten\" note. But the user said \"preserve all relevant information\", so even if it\\'s a note about needing a rewrite, that\\'s part of the source\\'s content and should be included.\\n\\nBut also, the actual content of the PDFs. For example, Source 2 from first search has the PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary says \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style... The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2...\" etc. So I need to include that entire summary verbatim.\\n\\nSimilarly, Source 3 from first search\\'s summary: \"In 2021, we will learn to live again. The All-New Classic 350 has been made for this journey. Efortless power and precise control in perfect harmony. Impeccably crafted lines and an instantly recognisable heartbeat. The Classic 350. Welcome back. CLOSE YOUR EYES. OPEN THEM AND BREATHE. SIT UP. PRESS THE STARTER. FEEL THE THUMP. FEEL THE WARMTH OF THE SUN. THE STRENGTH OF THE WIND. THE WONDER OF THE RAIN. LIKE IT’S THE FIRST TIME AGAIN. IT’S TIME TO SEE THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD CLEARER THAN EVER BEFORE. TO FEEL THE MOST ALIVE YOU’VE EVER FELT. BREATHE IN. BREATHE OUT. HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH. TAKE IT ALL IN. BE REBORN. The All-New Classic 350 continues to embody the traditions and craftsmanship of the past as it is reborn on the new J platform. Inspired by the post war G2 model, frst born in 2008, the Classic 350 of 2021 continues to celebrate the timeless aesthetic through the curvaceous mudguards and teardrop fuel tank, hallmark casquette headlamp, enduring lines of the crankcase covers...\"\\n\\nSo all of that needs to be included verbatim.\\n\\nSimilarly, for the price searches, the Smartprix entry says \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price in India starts from ₹1,93,080 and goes upto ₹2,30,000. Royal Enfield Classic 350 is a Cruiser Bike powered by a Oil Cooled 349\" Wait, the last part says \"Oil Cooled 349\" which might be a typo for 349cc, but the summary is as given.\\n\\nBikeWale\\'s summary: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 On Road Price in Kolkata\" with tables showing ex-showroom, RTO, insurance, on-road price, and variants.\\n\\nHindustan Times has a summary with an image link, but the actual text might be minimal.\\n\\nThen the Cycle World Buyer\\'s Guide: \"2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 The world’s oldest motorcycle brand brings back the Classic with a modern powerplant.\" etc.\\n\\nMotorcycle News review: \"2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality\" by Dan Sutherland, with highlights and a table.\\n\\nNow, for the citation rules: Assign each unique URL a single citation number. Then list them in the Sources section with numbers.\\n\\nFirst, list all URLs from all sources. Let\\'s check duplicates.\\n\\nCheck all the URLs:\\n\\nFrom first search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\nSecond search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n- Source 2: https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n- Source 3: https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\nThird search:\\n\\n- Source 1: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n- Source 2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (duplicate of first search source 1)\\n\\n- Source 3: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nFourth search: \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\" but the response shows same as third search\\'s source 1 and others. So the URLs would be same as before.\\n\\nSo unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (used in first search source 1, third search source 2)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n\\nSo 8 unique URLs. Assign each a number.\\n\\nNow, in the findings section, for each source, when it\\'s mentioned, cite the number. But the output format requires \"List of Queries and Tool Calls Made\", then \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\", then \"List of All Relevant Sources\".\\n\\nSo first, list all the queries made:\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 price India official\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications site:royalenfield.com\"\\n\\n- \"Royal Enfield Classic 350 review Cycle World\"\\n\\nThen in Fully Comprehensive Findings, present each source\\'s content verbatim, with the citation number. For example, if a source is from the first search, then when describing it, state [1] Source title: URL and then the summary.\\n\\nBut according to the guidelines: \"return inline citations for each source that the researcher found\". So when listing the findings, each part of the content should be cited with the number corresponding to the source.\\n\\nWait, the example says: \"These three sources all stated X [1][2][3]\".\\n\\nBut the exact instruction: \"In your report, you should return inline citations for each source that the researcher found.\"\\n\\nSo for each fact or piece of information from a source, cite the source number. But since the sources are the search results, each search result is a source. So each of the 8 URLs is a source, each gets a number. Then in the findings section, whenever a specific piece of info comes from a source, mark it with [number].\\n\\nBut in this case, the \"findings\" are the summaries from each search result. So perhaps the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section should list each search result\\'s summary verbatim, with the citation number next to it. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, structure the findings as follows: For each query, list the search results, each with their summary and citation.\\n\\nBut the output format says:\\n\\n**List of Queries and Tool Calls Made**\\n\\n**Fully Comprehensive Findings**\\n\\n**List of All Relevant Sources (with citations in the report)**\\n\\nSo in the Fully Comprehensive Findings, present all the information gathered, with inline citations. For example, if a source provides some specs, then state that info and cite the source.\\n\\nBut in the search results provided, each source\\'s summary is given. So for each of those summaries, they need to be included verbatim, and each should be cited with the source number.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the same URL might appear multiple times (like Wikipedia), but according to citation rules, assign each unique URL a single number.\\n\\nSo first, list all the unique URLs and assign them numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list them in order of first occurrence:\\n\\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic (from first search source 1)\\n\\n2. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf (first search source 2)\\n\\n3. https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf (first search source 3)\\n\\n4. https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn (second search source 1)\\n\\n5. https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/ (second search source 2)\\n\\n6. https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350 (second search source 3)\\n\\n7. https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/ (third search source 1)\\n\\n8. https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/ (third search source 3)\\n\\nSo these 8 unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, for each search result (i.e., each entry in the tool responses), present the summary verbatim, and note which source it is with the citation number.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nFrom the first tool call (\"Royal Enfield Classic 350 specifications official site\"), the results were:\\n\\nSource 1: Wikipedia article. The summary includes \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia... [rest of the summary]\". So in findings, write that text and cite [1].\\n\\nSource 2: The PDF from Royal Enfield\\'s site. The summary text: \"Gleaming colours. Unwavering style. The Classic 350. The Classic 350 traces its bloodline to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2—and this perfectly-proportioned silhouette has been in fashion ever since.

This is from source [2].\\n\\nSimilarly for others.\\n\\nSo the Fully Comprehensive Findings should list all these summaries, each with the citation number.\\n\\nThen the Sources section lists all 8 URLs with their numbers.\\n\\nBut the user said \"preserve all relevant information verbatim\". So even if a source is a Wikipedia article that says \"may need to be rewritten\", we have to include that exact text.\\n\\nLet\\'s check the exact text of each source\\'s summary as provided in the tool responses.\\n\\nFor example, first search\\'s Source 1:\\n\\n\"--- SOURCE 1: Royal Enfield Classic - Wikipedia --- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic SUMMARY: [Jump to content](#bodyContent) # Royal Enfield Classic * [हिन्दी](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AB%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95 \"रॉयल एनफील्ड क्लासिक – Hindi\") [Edit links](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityPage/Q30636956#sitelinks-wikipedia \"Edit interlanguage links\") From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Motorcycle model |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | This article **may need to be rewritten** to comply with Wikipedia\\'s [quality standards](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style\").

So the exact text from each SOURCE in the tool responses should be included.\\n\\nSo for example, in the tool call responses, each source is listed as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo in the cleaned report, I need to take that exact structure, but cite it properly.\\n\\nBut the guidelines say: \"preserve all of the relevant statements and information that the researcher has gathered.

The \"Tool Call Filtering\" says to exclude think_tool calls, but include tavily_search results.\\n\\nThe existing messages contain the tool_call responses. Each search result is presented as:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: ... ---\\n\\nURL: ...\\n\\nSUMMARY: ...\\n\\nSo the cleaned report should take all the SOURCE entries from the search results, and present them in the Fully Comprehensive Findings section, with the URL and summary.\\n\\nBut to do that properly, for each SOURCE in the tool responses, take the URL and SUMMARY, and present them with the citation number.\\n\\nBut the user wants inline citations, so when a specific fact is mentioned in the findings, cite the source. However, in this case, the findings are the raw summaries from the search results.

       "  'Okay, let\\'s tackle this. The user wants me to clean up the research findings for the Honda CB 350, preserving all relevant info verbatim. First, I need to check the messages provided and see what sources were gathered.\\n\\nLooking at the tool calls and responses. The user asked for detailed info on Honda CB 350 specs, performance, pricing, features, pros/cons, using official and reputable sources.\\n\\nFirst, there were three tool calls. The first was \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\" which returned three sources. Then a think_tool reflection about needing more official info, then another search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", and another for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\". But the responses to those searches are in the messages.\\n\\nWait, the last two searches might not have actual content. Let me check the search results.\\n\\nFirst search (query: \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\"):\\n\\n- Source 1: CMC Help Center, URL https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs. Summary says 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp, torque, top speed 110mph, 5-speed, dry weight 328 lb.\\n\\n- Source 2: Universal Honda, URL https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html. Shows a table with variants, prices, engine displacement 348.36 CC, power 21.07 PS @5500 rpm, etc.\\n\\n- Source 3: BikeWale, URL https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/. But the summary shows \"Oops! No suggestions found\" and some city selection stuff. Wait, that seems like a broken page. Maybe the actual content wasn\\'t retrieved properly. But the user said to preserve all, so even if it\\'s a partial or error message, it should be included verbatim.\\n\\nThen the think_tool response was internal, so it should be excluded as per the instructions.\\n\\nNext tool call was \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", which returned three sources again. Wait, looking at the first source again: same as Source 1 from before? The URL is the same. The summary is similar. Then Source 2 is BikeWale again (same as before), Source 3 is Universal Honda again. So maybe duplicate sources.\\n\\nWait the third search was \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\" but the response was not shown? Wait no, the user provided the tool call and the response. Let\\'s check.\\n\\nAfter the first search, the response had three sources. Then the think_tool reflection. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", which gave three sources again. The first source in that response is the same CMC Help Center URL. Then BikeWale again, then Universal Honda again. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\". Let\\'s check the response for that.\\n\\nWait, in the messages provided, after the second tavily_search (site:honda.co.in), the response was three sources, but then there\\'s another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", but the response isn\\'t shown. Wait the last part of the user\\'s message says:\\n\\n\" All above messages are about research conducted by an AI Researcher for the following research topic: [...] Your task is to clean up these research findings [...]\"\\n\\nSo in the messages, the last tool call was \"tavily_search\" with \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", but the \"dall\" response is empty? Wait no, looking at the user\\'s input:\\n\\nThe last part is:\\n\\n<user>\\nThe last message is:\\n\\n<user>\\nAll above messages are about research conducted by an AI Researcher for the following research topic:\\n\\nRESEARCH TOPIC: Gather detailed information on the Honda CB 350, focusing on its specifications, performance metrics, pricing, features, and pros and cons.

Let me check the structure.\\n\\nThe history starts with the initial user query. Then the assistant did a tavily_search for \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\", got three sources. Then a think_tool reflection. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", which returned three sources (but maybe duplicates). Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", and then a response. Wait, looking at the messages:\\n\\nIn the user\\'s message that\\'s the current query, the history includes:\\n\\n- First user message: the task.\\n\\n- Then the assistant\\'s first tool call: tavily_search with \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\", then the response (three sources).\\n\\n- Then the assistant did a think_tool.\\n\\n- Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", response with three sources.\\n\\n- Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", and then a response, but in the provided history, the response for that might not be shown? Wait, the user provided all messages. Let me check.\\n\\nLooking at the user\\'s input:\\n\\nThe user provided all the messages. Let\\'s parse them.\\n\\nFirst, the initial user message is the task. Then the AI assistant has a series of messages:\\n\\n1. The first tool call (tavily_search with query \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\")\\n\\n2. The response from that tool call (three sources: CMC Help Center, Universal Honda, BikeWale)\\n\\n3. Then a think_tool call with reflection.\\n\\n4. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\", with response (three sources, same URLs as before?)\\n\\n5. Then another tavily_search for \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", and then a response.\\n\\nWait, but in the user\\'s input, the last part shows:\\n\\nAfter the second tavily_search (site:honda.co.in), the response is listed as three sources (same as before), then another tool call: tavily_search with \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\", but the response for that is not shown.

None of the results are from honda.com. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any results from honda.com. That\\'s important to note.\\n\\nNow, the task is to clean up all the relevant information from these sources, preserving verbatim, excluding think_tool calls.\\n\\nSo first, list all the tool calls that are relevant. The tavily_search calls and their responses, but exclude the think_tool.\\n\\nSo the relevant tool responses are:\\n\\n1. First tavily_search (query \"Honda CB 350 official specifications\") returned three sources.\\n\\n2. Second tavily_search (query \"Honda CB350 official specifications site:honda.co.in\") returned three sources.\\n\\n3. Third tavily_search (query \"Honda CB350 official site:honda.com\") returned three sources.\\n\\nBut all these sources have overlapping URLs. For example, the CMC Help Center URL is repeated in all three searches.\\n\\nNow, the task is to list all these sources, but without duplicates. However, the instruction says to preserve all information, including duplicates if they are in the sources. But the citation rules say to assign each unique URL a single citation number. So even if the same URL appears multiple times in different searches, it should be cited once.\\n\\nSo first, collect all the unique URLs from all the tool responses.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all URLs from the search results:\\n\\nFrom first tavily_search response:\\n\\nSource 1: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSource 2: https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\nSource 3: https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nSecond tavily_search response:\\n\\nSame three URLs again. So same sources.\\n\\nThird tavily_search response for \"site:honda.com\" also shows same three URLs. So the official Honda site search didn\\'t return any honda.com URLs, so all sources are the same.\\n\\nThus, unique URLs are three: CMC, Universal Honda, BikeWale.\\n\\nNow, for each of these, we need to include all the summary text verbatim.\\n\\nBut in the first search, the CMC source summary was:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\"\\n\\nIn the third search\\'s Source 1, it says:\\n\\n\"SUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\"\\n\\nSo slightly different. So need to include both versions? Wait, but it\\'s the same URL. However, the summaries are different. So perhaps the same URL was accessed multiple times with different content? Or maybe the CMC Help Center page has different summaries depending on when it was accessed. But the instructions say to preserve all information verbatim, so if the same URL has different summary text in different responses, we need to include all instances.\\n\\nBut looking at the first search response for Source 1:\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Honda CB350 Specs - CMC Help Center ---\\nURL: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThe Honda CB350 has a 325.6cc engine, 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, 110mph top speed, 5-speed transmission, and weighs 328 lb (dry).\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThen in the third search, Source 1 has:\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nDec 3, 2018—Honda CB350 Specs· Manufacturer: Honda · Engine: 325.6 cc (19.87 cu in) OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin, · Bore / stroke: 64 mm × 50.6 mm (\\n\\nSo different summary. So even though same URL, the summary text is different. So need to include both instances.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Universal Honda source in first search had a table, and in the third search, the same URL again has the same table.\\n\\nBikeWale in first search: summary says \"Oops! No suggestions found\" etc. But in the third search, same URL again, same summary.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n- For each unique URL, collect all the summary data from all the times it appeared in the search results, and include them verbatim.\\n\\nBut if the same URL has multiple summaries (like in different searches), include all summaries.\\n\\nNow, the steps to create the report:\\n\\n1. List all queries and tool calls made (the tavily_search queries, but not think_tool).\\n\\n2. Fully comprehensive findings: for each source, include all the summary text verbatim, with citations.\\n\\n3. Sources section listing each unique URL with citation number.\\n\\nBut according to the citation rules, each unique URL gets one citation number, regardless of how many times it appears in the search results. But in the findings, whenever the URL is mentioned, cite it with the number.\\n\\nWait, no. The citation rules say: Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text. End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers.\\n\\nSo for example, if the same URL appears in multiple places in the findings, each time cite the same number.\\n\\nBut in the \"Fully Comprehensive Findings\" section, we need to list all the information from the sources, each time citing the URL with its number.\\n\\nSo first, collect all unique URLs and assign numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s list all unique URLs:\\n\\n1. https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n\\n2. https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n\\n3. https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/\\n\\nThat\\'s three unique URLs.\\n\\nNow, for each URL, in the findings section, include all the summary text from all instances.\\n\\nFor example, the first URL appeared in the first search\\'s Source 1 with the first summary, and in the third search\\'s Source 1 with the second summary.

       " 'final_report': 'This report provides a detailed comparison between the Royal Enfield Classic 350 and the Honda CB 350, drawing on official manufacturer sources and reputable review platforms to cover specifications, performance metrics, pricing, features, pros and cons, and overall suitability. The analysis considers all relevant dimensions to offer a comprehensive overview of these two popular motorcycles.\\n\\n## Royal Enfield Classic 350 Overview\\n\\nThe Royal Enfield Classic 350 is presented as a motorcycle deeply rooted in heritage and timeless aesthetics, tracing its lineage back to the 1950 Royal Enfield G2 model [2][3]. It embodies the traditions and craftsmanship of the past while being reborn on the modern J platform in 2021 [3]. The design is characterized by its perfectly-proportioned silhouette, curvaceous mudguards, teardrop fuel tank, and hallmark casquette headlamp [2][3]. The motorcycle is described as having \"unwavering style\" and is available in seven striking new colorways inspired by its history [2]. It is highlighted for its blend of modern engineering and traditional handcrafting, resulting in an \"indomitable DNA\" and a deep, throaty exhaust note [2]. Reviewers note its \"character styling, and quality\" and \"just enough power\" for its segment [8].\\n\\n## Honda CB 350 Overview\\n\\nThe Honda CB 350, based on the research findings, is presented primarily through its technical specifications and pricing. It features a 325.6cc OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin engine with a bore/stroke of 64 mm × 50.6 mm [9]. Another source indicates an engine displacement of 348.36 CC [10]. The motorcycle is equipped with a 5-speed transmission, double disc brakes, and a multiplate wet clutch [9][10]. Its kerb weight is listed as 187 kg, with a self-start only mechanism [10]. Performance figures vary across sources, with one stating 36 bhp power, 2.55 kg·m torque, and a top speed of 110 mph (approximately 177 km/h) [9], while another lists 21.07 PS @ 5500 rpm [10]. The research did not yield extensive details on its design philosophy or specific pros and cons from review platforms, with one search result indicating no suggestions found for specifications and features [11].\\n\\n## Detailed Comparison\\n\\n### Specifications\\n\\n**Engine and Performance:**\\nThe Royal Enfield Classic 350 is powered by a 349cc oil-cooled engine, built on the new J platform [3][4]. While specific power and torque figures were not explicitly provided in the summaries for the Classic 350, reviews suggest it offers \"just enough power\" [8] and \"effortless power and precise control\" [3].\\n\\nFor the Honda CB 350, the engine displacement is noted as 325.6cc OHC air-cooled 180° parallel twin [9], with another source specifying 348.36 CC [10]. Power figures show a notable discrepancy: one source states 36 bhp, 2.55 kg·m torque, and a top speed of 110 mph (approximately 177 km/h) [9], while another lists 21.07 PS @ 5500 rpm [10]. It\\'s important to note that 36 bhp is significantly higher than 21.07 PS (approximately 20.78 bhp), indicating different models or measurement standards, or a data inconsistency in the sources. The Honda CB 350 features a 5-speed transmission [9][10].\\n\\n**Chassis, Brakes, and Weight:**\\nThe Royal Enfield Classic 350\\'s \"signature stance\" includes an upright riding position [2]. The Redditch variant is equipped with disc brakes and spoke wheels [5]. Specific weight figures for the Classic 350 were not available in the provided research summaries.\\n\\nThe Honda CB 350 features double disc brakes and a multiplate wet clutch [10]. Its kerb weight is cited as 187 kg [10]. Another source provides a dry weight of 328 lb (approximately 148.8 kg) [9], which is a significant difference from the kerb weight, possibly due to different measurement standards (dry vs. kerb/wet weight).\\n\\n### Pricing\\n\\n**Royal Enfield Classic 350:**\\nIn India, the price for the Royal Enfield Classic 350 starts from ₹1,93,080 and can go up to ₹2,30,000 [4]. The on-road price in Kolkata for the Classic 350 Redditch variant is ₹2,12,485, which includes an ex-showroom price of ₹1,81,118, RTO charges of ₹19,612, and comprehensive insurance of ₹11,755 [5].\\n\\n**Honda CB 350:**\\nThe ex-showroom prices for the Honda CB 350 variants are as follows [10]:\\n*   Honda CB350 DLX (Petrol): ₹197,806\\n*   Honda CB350 DLX Pro (Petrol): ₹200,866\\n*   Honda CB350C Special Edition (Petrol): ₹201,900\\n\\nBased on these figures, both motorcycles fall within a similar price bracket, with the Honda CB 350\\'s ex-showroom prices being slightly higher for its base variants compared to the starting price of the Classic 350.\\n\\n### Features and Design\\n\\n**Royal Enfield Classic 350:**\\nThe Classic 350 is celebrated for its distinctive design, drawing inspiration from the post-war G2 model [3]. Key design elements include curvaceous mudguards, a teardrop fuel tank, and a hallmark casquette headlamp [3]. It is available in various \"gleaming colours\" and is characterized by its \"unmistakable style\" and \"unrivalled craftsmanship,\" blending modern engineering with traditional handcrafting [2]. The motorcycle also features a \"deep, throaty exhaust note\" [2].\\n\\n**Honda CB 350:**\\nThe provided research for the Honda CB 350 primarily focuses on technical specifications. Features mentioned include its double disc braking system, multiplate wet clutch, and self-start only ignition [10]. There were no explicit descriptions of its aesthetic design or unique styling features in the summarized findings. The search for features on a reputable platform resulted in an \"Oops! No suggestions found\" page [11], limiting insights into its user-perceived features.\\n\\n### Pros and Cons / Overall Suitability\\n\\n**Royal Enfield Classic 350:**\\n*   **Pros:** Strong emphasis on heritage, \"timeless aesthetic,\" \"character styling, and quality\" [2][3][8]. It offers an \"instantly recognisable heartbeat\" and enduring appeal [3][2]. The motorcycle is designed for effortless power and precise control, suitable for a journey of self-discovery [3]. Its blend of modern engineering and traditional handcrafting creates a unique appeal [2].\\n*   **Cons:** While described as having \"just enough power\" [8], this might be a con for riders seeking more spirited performance. The research did not explicitly detail other cons from review platforms. The Wikipedia source noted it \"may need to be rewritten\" [1], which is a limitation of the source itself, not the bike.\\n*   **Suitability:** The Classic 350 appears well-suited for riders who appreciate classic styling, a comfortable upright riding position, and a relaxed, characterful riding experience. It appeals to those who value heritage and a distinctive presence on the road over outright speed or cutting-edge technology.\\n\\n**Honda CB 350:**\\n*   **Pros:** Based on the available specifications, it offers a robust engine and modern braking (double disc) [9][10]. The kerb weight of 187 kg [10] (or 328 lb dry weight [9]) suggests a manageable size. The multiple variants offer choices in pricing and potentially features [10].\\n*   **Cons:** The research did not provide specific pros and cons from reputable reviews, limiting a direct comparison in this aspect. The conflicting power and weight figures from different sources [9][10] could be a point of confusion for potential buyers seeking precise information. The lack of detailed design descriptions also makes it harder to assess its aesthetic appeal in comparison to the Classic 350.\\n*   **Suitability:** The Honda CB 350, with its specifications, appears to be a contender for riders looking for a reliable, moderately powerful motorcycle in the 350cc segment. Its \"self-start only\" feature suggests modern convenience. Without more detailed review insights, it\\'s challenging to pinpoint its exact niche, but it likely targets riders seeking a blend of Honda\\'s reliability with a classic-inspired form factor, though the research didn\\'t highlight its classic design elements as strongly as for the Royal Enfield.\\n\\nIn summary, the Royal Enfield Classic 350 strongly leverages its heritage and distinctive aesthetic, offering a characterful and classic riding experience. The Honda CB 350, while presenting competitive specifications and pricing, lacks detailed qualitative insights from the provided research, making it harder to fully assess its unique appeal and riding experience in comparison.\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] Royal Enfield Classic - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Classic\\n[2] Royal Enfield Classic 350 Technical Specifications: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/open-pdf/royal-enfield-classic-350_technical-specifications-en.pdf\\n[3] Specification-classic-350: https://www.royalenfield.com/content/dam/royal-enfield/classic-350/thailand/specification-classic-350.pdf\\n[4] Royal Enfield Classic 350 Price in India 2025: https://www.smartprix.com/bikes/royal-enfield-classic-350-ppd1xvaqrpzn\\n[5] Royal Enfield Classic 350 On Road Price in Kolkata: https://www.bikewale.com/royalenfield-bikes/classic-350/price-in-kolkata/\\n[6] Royal Enfield Classic 350 - On-Road Price, Specs, Reviews: https://auto.hindustantimes.com/new-bikes/royalenfield/classic-350\\n[7] 2022 Royal Enfield Classic 350 Buyer\\'s Guide: https://www.cycleworld.com/story/buyers-guide/royal-enfield-classic-350-2022/\\n[8] 2022-on Royal Enfield Classic 350 Review: Just enough power, character styling, and quality: https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/enfield/classic-350/2022/\\n[9] Honda CB350 Specs - CMC Help Center: https://support.common-motor.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020473891-Honda-CB350-Specs\\n[10] Honda CB350 Specs & Features, Configurations, Dimensions: https://www.universalhonda.com/new-bikes/honda-cb350/specification.html\\n[11] Specifications & Features of Honda CB350 - BikeWale: https://www.bikewale.com/honda-bikes/cb350/specifications-features/'}"
